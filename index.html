        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is John Henry Guzman. Iâ€™m a Mexican-American 19 year-old teenager attending the University of California, Riverside as a History major. I am the first in my family on both sides of the family to ever attend a higher education at a university. Before I begin, some few words I would use to describe myself are: self conscious, responsible, respectful, sociable, friendly, open-minded, determined, and academically driven. All throughout my k-12 education I was pushed with motivation, emotionally and physically supported by my mother. She was always there as my number one supporter to see me succeed and reach my goals. Both my parents only finished highschool in Mexico and still gave me the most possible opportunities to follow my dreams in order to make a career for myself. I owe them a lot for the reason where Iâ€™m standing now, which only determines me to go even further.<br><br>

        Why UCR? For starters, I never believed I would have the chance to possibly have the opportunity to attend a university because of the frightening tuition. My family and I have always been from a low-income status. At times living check by check. As soon as I reached the legal age of 16, I started working in the fast food industry in a restaurant called Jack In The Box. Even though I was making a bit of money, I was mostly helping out my mom with any bills or little things I needed I would buy myself. I still didnâ€™t make enough for a high tuition like UCRâ€™s. Entering my last year of high school, I took my shot at applying for possible universities and cal states. I realized I would first calculate and consider my FAFSA aid. Soon enough I realized my possibilities were opening and I would have enough financial support to pursue my dreams. I had the opportunity to go to either California State University of San Bernardino or UCR. I was very close to choosing CSUSB because it was cheaper and because I got waitlisted on my top choice, UCR. Soon after that, I received an acceptance email from UCR and I was able to attend this wonderful research university. UCR has always been my top choice and I wanted to pursue a higher education in teaching.<br><br>

        I hope to accomplish many things here at UCR. I hope to join many clubs and involve myself around campus. I hope to do well in my 4 years, receiving my bachelors degree in History. After I graduate, I will join the masterâ€™s program at UCR. In about a year I can obtain both my Masterâ€™s degree and teaching credentials. Finally, I hope to grasp as much experience and knowledge I can get from my years at UCR and pursue teaching history in High School where I can help my community and educate future generations.
